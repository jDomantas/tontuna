* code is for computers, comments are for humans
    * humans are smarter than computers, so code is for humans too
* code needs to contain comments to explain things
* comments need to contain code as examples
* first-class: allow source introspection (?)
* allow metaprogramming to allow constructing and executing code at runtime (eval?)
* use cases:
    * literate programming: program is a comment with code pieces, a program can assemble itself back by inspecting code bits inside contents
    * doc generation: program can generate its own docs by inspecting comments inside code
    * doc tests: custom test runner that checks code contained in comments
